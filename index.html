            <p>Software engineer</p>
            <p>I am a sophomore at Iowa State University, majoring in Computer science.

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
            only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
            creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
            Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
            text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
            two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
            related to the project itself.</p>
